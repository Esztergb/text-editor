## User Story

```md
AS A developer
I WANT to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection
SO THAT I can reliably retrieve them for later use
```

## Description 

This application was built for the purpose of demonstrating and learn about progressive web application. Its purpose was to gather a greater understanding of what React JavaScript library is really doing behind the scenes. There are four main concepts this application focuses on. One, configuring the webpack.config.js file with the necessary workbox plugins for service worker and manifest files, and adding CSS and babel loader (enabling the CSS and JavaScript to compile on devices running on older legacy code i.e. ES5). Two, implementing asset caching within the src-sw.js file giving the application offline  functionality. Three, configuring the database, so that data can be added, updated and retrieved from the IndexedDB. And four, adding the addition of event handlers to our install button, so that the application can be installed to each users personal application stack and be used offline.

Although much of this application functions on a boilerplate code structure, building it out helped me to a greater understanding of the functionality of libraries and frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue. As of now I have no plans for future development, however this application can function as a benchmark boilerplate code base for the development of future progressive web applications.
